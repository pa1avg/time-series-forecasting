The forecast is based on the Mean Squared Error.

A preliminary analysis of the data including both numerical and graphical summaries.
• Examine the components of the time series: the underlying trend, seasonality and error and produce a decomposition plot.
• Investigate a selection of time series models to see which model provides a good fit to the observed data.
  o Baseline & simple approaches, including: Naïve, Mean,Moving Average, Simple Linear Regression.
  o Complex approaches including: SES, Holt Linear, Holt Winters,ARIMAs.
Finally, as a result a research poster is generated to visualise and understand the techniques used for the forecast which compares different types of models.
